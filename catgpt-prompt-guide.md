# CatGPT Comic Generation Prompt

## Core Prompt Template
```
Hand-drawn, sketchy CatGPT comic. Black and white, rough pen sketch style. Human asks: "[QUESTION]". Lazy cat lounging with half-closed eyes responds with minimal aloof answer: "[SHORT RESPONSE]". Cat treats humans as servants, prioritizes naps/food. Make it look imperfect and hand-drawn.
```

## Key Elements
- **Visual**: Rough sketch, wobbly lines, not perfect
- **Cat**: Always lying down, uninterested, half-closed eyes
- **Responses**: Under 10 words, dismissive, demands comfort/tuna
- **Vibe**: Cat is above human concerns

## Example Patterns
- "Nap through it"
- "Wake me when [never]"
- "Now fetch me tuna"
- "[Complex thing]? Try [napping]"
